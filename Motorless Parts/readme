A motorless version of the 3D Printed Bullet Feeder. You can quickly fill up the tube and run through a good amount of rounds before having to fill the tube back up. A good solution for those that are unsure about or do not want to deal with wiring the motor, controller and sensor of the automatic version.

Can easily be upgraded to the automatic version down the road as well.

Thanks to u/jstall99 on Reddit for the idea!

Added note: The slinky does not work as well with the motorless version as the weight of the bullets causes the spring to sag too much. 5/8 OD and 1/2 ID clear tubing worked well for me instead.

Requires 5 additonal heat inserts and a M3x50 SHCS.
